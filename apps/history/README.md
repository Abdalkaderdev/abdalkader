- **Fallback**: `mixtral-8x7b-32768` - More detailed responses for complex queries

### Customization
- Modify language data in `src/lib/data/languages.json`
- Add new paradigms in `src/components/ParadigmExplorer.tsx`
- Customize AI prompts in `src/lib/prompts/`
- Adjust styling in `src/app/globals.css`

## üìä Performance

- **AI Response Time**: < 2 seconds (Groq's ultra-fast inference)
- **Caching**: Smart caching of AI responses to reduce API calls
- **Animations**: 60fps GSAP animations
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with dynamic imports
