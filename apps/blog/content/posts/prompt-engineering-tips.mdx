Prompt engineering is the art of communicating with AI. Here's what I've learned building AI features for production apps.

## The Foundation: Clear Instructions

Bad prompt:
```
Write something about a product.
```

Good prompt:
```
Write a 50-word product description for a CRM software targeted at small businesses.
Focus on ease of use and time savings.
Use a professional but friendly tone.
```

Specificity matters. Always.

## System Prompts Are Your Foundation

For SoapBox's AI content generator, our system prompt includes:

```
You are a content assistant for faith-based organizations.
Your tone is warm, encouraging, and spiritually-minded.
You never use profanity or controversial topics.
You always suggest relevant Bible verses when appropriate.
```

This shapes every response without repeating instructions.

## The Power of Examples (Few-Shot)

Instead of explaining what you want, show it:

```
Create social media posts in this style:

Example 1:
"Join us this Sunday! Pastor Mike is continuing our series on Grace.
Doors open at 9:30am. See you there! 🙏"

Example 2:
"Reminder: Youth Group meets tonight at 7pm.
Bring a friend and join us for games, worship, and real talk. 🎮✝️"

Now create a post about our upcoming community service event on Saturday.
```

## Chain of Thought for Complex Tasks

For ParsaLink's lead qualification AI:

```
Analyze this lead and determine their buying intent.

Think step by step:
1. What information did they request?
2. What timeline did they mention?
3. What budget indicators are present?
4. What pain points did they express?

Based on your analysis, rate the lead as Hot, Warm, or Cold, and explain why.
```

This produces more accurate results than asking directly.

## Structured Output

When you need specific formats, be explicit:

```
Analyze this customer feedback and respond in JSON:

{
  "sentiment": "positive" | "negative" | "neutral",
  "topics": ["array", "of", "topics"],
  "urgency": 1-5,
  "suggested_action": "string"
}
```

Or use Claude's native JSON mode when available.

## Temperature and Model Selection

My guidelines:
- **Temperature 0**: Factual, consistent outputs (data extraction)
- **Temperature 0.3-0.5**: Balanced creativity (content generation)
- **Temperature 0.7+**: Creative tasks (brainstorming)

For production:
- **Fast responses**: Claude Haiku or GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Complex reasoning**: Claude Sonnet or GPT-4
- **Creative tasks**: Higher temperature + capable model

## Error Handling in Prompts

Always include fallbacks:

```
If you cannot determine the user's intent, respond with:
{
  "status": "unclear",
  "follow_up_question": "Could you please clarify..."
}

Never make up information. If unsure, say so.
```

## Testing Your Prompts

I maintain a test suite for prompts:

```python
test_cases = [
    {"input": "I need help ASAP!", "expected_urgency": 5},
    {"input": "Just browsing", "expected_urgency": 1},
    {"input": "We need this by Q1", "expected_urgency": 3},
]

for case in test_cases:
    result = llm.classify(case["input"])
    assert result["urgency"] == case["expected_urgency"]
```

Prompts are code. Test them like code.

## Version Control for Prompts

Store prompts in files, not inline:

```
prompts/
  lead_qualification_v2.txt
  content_generation_v1.txt
  sentiment_analysis_v3.txt
```

This enables:
- Version history
- A/B testing
- Easy rollback

## The Meta-Prompt

When creating new prompts, I use Claude to help:

```
I need to create a prompt for [use case].
The input will be [description].
The output should be [format].

Generate a prompt that:
- Is clear and specific
- Includes examples
- Handles edge cases
- Produces consistent results
```

AI helping build better AI.

## Continuous Improvement

1. Log all prompts and responses
2. Review failures weekly
3. Iterate based on real usage
4. A/B test major changes

Prompt engineering is never "done." It's an ongoing process.

Good luck, and happy prompting!
