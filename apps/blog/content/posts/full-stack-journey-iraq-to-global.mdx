Growing up in Syria and later moving to Iraq, I never imagined I'd be building AI-powered applications for companies across the globe. Here's my story.

## The Beginning: Telecommunications

I started my journey studying Telecommunications Engineering at the University of Aleppo. Those years gave me a solid foundation in network design, wireless communication, and system architecture. Little did I know these skills would translate perfectly into software engineering.

## The Pivot to Web Development

The transition wasn't overnight. It started with curiosity—tinkering with HTML and CSS, then JavaScript. Soon I was building full websites for local businesses in Iraq.

What fascinated me most was the immediate feedback loop. Write code, see results. Fix a bug, solve a real problem. This was addictive.

## Going Full Stack

I quickly realized that to build complete products, I needed to understand both sides:

**Frontend**: React, Next.js, and eventually Svelte became my tools of choice. I love crafting user experiences that feel seamless.

**Backend**: Node.js was my gateway, but Python with Django and FastAPI opened new doors, especially for AI integration.

## The AI Revolution

When AI tools started becoming accessible, I dove in headfirst. Fine-tuning LLMs, building AI agents, implementing RAG systems—this felt like the future.

Now at SoapBox, I'm designing LLM-powered systems that help churches communicate better with their communities. At Mount Seir Tech, I'm leading backend architecture for an AI-powered CRM.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start where you are** - I didn't have access to Silicon Valley resources. I had internet and determination.

2. **Build in public** - Every project, even the failed ones, taught me something valuable.

3. **Remote work is real work** - Geography doesn't limit your opportunities anymore.

4. **AI is a multiplier** - Learn it, use it, build with it. It's not replacing developers—it's empowering them.

## What's Next

I'm continuing to explore the intersection of AI and web development. Building tools that matter, helping nonprofits digitize, and sharing what I learn along the way.
