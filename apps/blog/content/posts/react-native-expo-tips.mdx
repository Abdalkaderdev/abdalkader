Building ViaApp—a cross-platform discipleship app—taught me a lot about React Native and Expo. Here are the most valuable lessons.

## Why Expo?

When I started ViaApp, the decision was clear: we needed iOS, Android, AND web from a single codebase. Expo made this possible without ejecting.

```bash
npx create-expo-app ViaApp
```

That simple command started a journey that now serves thousands of users across all platforms.

## Lesson 1: Embrace Expo Router

Forget React Navigation for new projects. Expo Router brings file-based routing to React Native, and it's a game-changer.

```typescript
// app/(tabs)/devotional.tsx
export default function DevotionalScreen() {
  return <DailyDevotional />;
}
```

The folder structure IS your navigation structure. Simple, predictable, maintainable.

## Lesson 2: Offline-First is Non-Negotiable

Users don't always have internet. For a devotional app, this was critical.

```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Cache devotionals locally
const cacheDevotional = async (devotional) => {
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(
    `devotional-${devotional.date}`,
    JSON.stringify(devotional)
  );
};
```

We implemented a sync strategy that downloads content when online and serves from cache when offline.

## Lesson 3: Platform-Specific Code When Needed

While most code is shared, sometimes platforms need special treatment:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  shadow: Platform.select({
    ios: {
      shadowColor: '#000',
      shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
      shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    },
    android: {
      elevation: 4,
    },
    web: {
      boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)',
    },
  }),
});
```

## Lesson 4: EAS Build for Production

Development builds with Expo Go are great, but production needs EAS:

```bash
eas build --platform all
```

This handles code signing, app store requirements, and generates native binaries. Worth every penny of the subscription.

## Lesson 5: Push Notifications the Right Way

Expo's push notification service simplified what used to be a nightmare:

```typescript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

async function scheduleDailyReminder() {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "Time for your devotional",
      body: "Your daily reading is ready",
    },
    trigger: {
      hour: 7,
      minute: 0,
      repeats: true,
    },
  });
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use FlatList, not ScrollView** for lists
2. **Memoize components** that don't need frequent re-renders
3. **Optimize images** with expo-image instead of Image
4. **Enable Hermes** for faster JavaScript execution

## The Result

ViaApp now runs on:
- iOS (iPhone and iPad)
- Android (phones and tablets)
- Web (responsive PWA)

All from one codebase. One team. One deployment pipeline.

If you're building cross-platform, Expo is the way to go in 2024.
