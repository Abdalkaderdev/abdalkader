Having shipped production applications with both React and Svelte, I have opinions. Here's an honest comparison.

## The React Experience

React has been my go-to for years. The ecosystem is massive, job market is huge, and you can build anything.

```jsx
// React component
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Pros:**
- Massive ecosystem
- Great job market
- Excellent tooling (Next.js, Remix)
- Strong community support

**Cons:**
- Bundle size can grow fast
- Hooks have a learning curve
- Re-render optimization requires thought

## The Svelte Experience

When I joined Mount Seir Tech and started working with Svelte, it felt refreshingly simple.

```svelte
<!-- Svelte component -->
<script>
  let count = 0;

  $: document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
  Count: {count}
</button>
```

**Pros:**
- Less boilerplate
- Smaller bundle sizes
- True reactivity (no virtual DOM)
- Faster initial load times

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem
- Fewer job postings
- Less third-party component libraries

## Real Performance Comparison

On ParsaLink (our AI CRM), we measured:

| Metric | React | Svelte |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Bundle size | 145KB | 42KB |
| First paint | 1.2s | 0.6s |
| Time to interactive | 2.1s | 1.1s |

Svelte wins on raw performance, but React's ecosystem often makes up for it.

## When to Use Each

### Choose React when:
- You need a large ecosystem
- Your team already knows React
- You're building with Next.js
- You need easy hiring

### Choose Svelte when:
- Performance is critical
- You're building lightweight apps
- You want simpler code
- You're using SvelteKit

## My Current Approach

I use both:
- **React/Next.js** for portfolio sites, complex dashboards
- **Svelte** for AI-powered interfaces where speed matters

The "best" framework is the one that fits your project and team.

## The Future

Both are evolving:
- React Server Components are game-changing
- Svelte 5 with runes looks promising

Learn both. Use what fits. Stay pragmatic.
